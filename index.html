      <p>
        My name is Kamdilichukwu
        Kizito Egenti (Kamdi for short). My AltSchool ID is
        <b>ALT/SOE/024/0465</b> and this means I am currently enrolled in the
        Karatu cohort. Since you're already in this deep I'll talk a bit about
        myself. So follow me on this journey as I try to fit in, as much as
        possible, a lot of the practical web dev things I have picked up the past few weeks.

        My dad is from Anambra while my mom is from Enugu. I grew up in Enugu
        State, south east Nigeria (shoutout 042). Studied Geology at the University of Nigeria
        Nsukka. I grew up a
        Manchester United fan, and have the priviledge of seeing them live
        against Athletico. I grew up trying out a lot of sports so I have an
        affinity for it. Other sports which are a part of my regular routine are
        volleyball and bouldering, the latter being a recent pickup. Video games
        are something I enjoy as well as I grew up playing them. Tbh I love a
        lot of other things but I believe music and food trumps everything else.

        These days you can encounter me in the streets of Wroclaw, Poland, on a
        warm summer stroll in the evenings on my way back from work. I work here
        now as an Analyst in an investment bank. I speak English, Igbo and
        Pidgin exquisitely, read a bit of French, better Polish and even better
        German (and by that i mean A2 Deutsch).
        <i
          >Ich werde dir zeigen, was ich meine. Von jetzt werde ich nur noch in
          Deutsch schreiben. Ich mag nicht uber ich viele schreiben und das
          ist...</i
        >
        just kidding, just kidding.

        The reason I decided to pick this up is because I'm bored of my current
        job and would like to try out something else. The goal is to work
        remotely, earn a lot of money, travel more, invest back home, start a
        family without being broke and just live my life without fiscal
        restrictions. So due to my kinda busy schedule, AltSchool seemed the
        wisest choice to keep up with my work and learn something new within a
        structured setting. A structure is something I <b>reaaally</b> need so
        that was primarily the reason why i chose AltSchool. That and the fact
        that I can afford it, which brings it full circle sorta. You try out
        things you like when you have the financial might, that's why nepo
        babies stay winning. My goal, which I will now speak into existence is
        thus,
        <blockquote><q>
            I will graduate the Cloud Engineering tract and will make a good career out of this journey.
        </q>
        </blockquote>
        The dream, since I'm too scared of flying so I can't be a pilot, is that
        I work for a gaming development company and help make games, then after
        a while retire to Nigeria to open my firm with my friends or straight up
        use my money and build a farm, invest in underpriviledged kids and
        graduates from Nigerian universities who aren't first class or second
        class upper graduates.

        Hopefully this has been a not boring read for you and enough to show you
        who I am as a person. The great Jose Mourinho once said, "<i
          >We donâ€™t have to win, but we cannot lose.</i
        >"
      </p>
      <p>
        But I say, <i>"I <b>must</b> win."</i>
