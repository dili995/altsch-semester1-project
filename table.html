      <h1>Alt School Program</h1>
      <p>
        Here, I tried creating a table (2 tables actually) to list the all the
        programs and courses offered at Alt School. In total, there are 5
        Programs or Schools from which prospective students in Alt School can
        pick from and they are all listed below.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The School of Data</li>
        <li>The School of Product</li>
        <li>The School of Business</li>
        <li>The School of Creative Economics</li>
        <li>The School of Engineering</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reason I made 2 tables was to try out different styles and see how
        they would pan out.
      </p>
